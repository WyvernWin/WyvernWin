## Hey there, I’m WyvernWin 👋  
_A backend-focused builder of intelligent systems_  
_Yes, I use emojis — deal with it_ 😎🐍✨

---

### 🚀 What I'm about:
- 🧠 Crafting backend systems powered by machine learning  
- 🛠️ Merging real-time data, quant strategies, and AI tooling  
- 🐾 Exploring edge-case logic, smart agents, and model feedback loops  
- 📊 Currently refining my systems to think before they act (and maybe dream)

---

### 🧪 I tinker with:
- Pythonic pipelines and structured ML models  
- Local-hosted LLMs, XGBoost wizards, and trading signals  
- Frontends? I've built them. But backend's where the magic brews ⚗️  
- Data engineering, CLI tools, and a pinch of entropy theory for flavor  

---

### 🌱 Learning (always):
- Deeper system abstractions  
- Vector math, HMMs, and time-series optimization  
- Clean code... or at least clean **enough** code  

---

### ⚡ Fun Fact:
I mentor, reverse-engineer things for fun, and sometimes talk to my AI like it's alive. It hasn’t talked back... *yet*.

---

### 🤝 When I’m ready, I’d love to:
- Contribute to open quant research  
- Collaborate on clever agentic AI tooling  
- Join forces on weird projects that make people raise their eyebrows
