## Hey there, I’m WyvernWin 👋  
A backend-focused builder of intelligent systems😎🐍

Recently more fullstack app production with Go microservices✨
---

### 🚀 What I'm about:
- 🧠 Crafting backend systems powered by machine learning  
- 🛠️ Merging real-time data, quant strategies, and AI tooling/modifications  
- 🐾 Exploring edge-case logic, smart agents, and model feedback loops  
- 📊 Currently refining my systems to think before they act (and maybe dream)

---

### 🧪 I tinker with:
- Python pipelines and structured ML models using EDA and model blending, antioverfitting rare class truth seeker (*F1*/*PR-AUC*)
- Integrating local-hosted LLMs, XGBoost wizardry, and trading signals  
- Frontends? I've built them. But backend's where the magic brews ⚗️  
- Data engineering, CLI tools, and a pinch of entropy theory for flavor  

---

### 🌱 Learning (always)

- Reweaving the web: revisiting basics, exploring abstractions  
- Python, machine learning, and building tools that *breathe*  
- Vector math, systems thinking, and computer science foundations  
- Entropy, metaphysics, and how logic meets philosophy  
- Writing code that feels more like a thought than an instruction

---

### ⚡ Fun Fact:
I started learning Jan 2025, enjoy reverse-engineering things for fun, and sometimes talk to my AI like it's alive. It hasn’t messaged me first... *yet*.

---

### 🤝 When I’m ready, I’d love to:
- Contribute to open quant research  
- Collaborate on clever agentic AI tooling  
- Join forces on weird projects that make people raise their eyebrows - _generalisable human sentiment detection anyone?_
